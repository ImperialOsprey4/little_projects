# Contributing to the Little Projects Project

Welcome! Glad you're here and are interested in contributing. 

_most important thing_ - make sure you are registered for Hacktoberfest otherwise none of your pull requests will count.
Here's the link again in case you have lost it: https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/register

When you're registered and logged in on their site, you can keep track of your pull requests at https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/profile

Here are the steps:

1. In the top right of your screen you should see a little button that says "fork" - this makes a copy of the repository for you to work on independently.
2. Once you have your fork, find an issue, and get yourself assigned to it. This ensures that more than one person isn't working on a single task. If you want to write up a project that isn't there yet, create your own issue and get it assigned to yourself.
3. Once assigned, create a new branch in your forked repository. Work on your code/documentation in there, not in the main branch.
4. Submit your code or documentation by starting a pull request. It's best to only submit one thing at a time, when you think it's complete, eg just the code example.
5. Await your pull request being merged into the main branch and tick off one of your four pull requests!

Those are the basics, but obviously there are a few more things to it. A project for this repository deliberately needs 4 things so you can get your four pull requests:
- a readme file to explain what the example does, and a list of what physical equipment you need. <br> Include any other things you can do with the same kit if you can.
This should be written using Markdown (and the file saved as README.md) - if you haven't used it before then [there is a cheatsheet here.](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)
- the code example itself
- a wiring diagram or clear annotated photo of a breadboard
- a review of someone else's code for any linting issues or things that need clarification/comments

#### Vague code of conduct:

Please make sure that the language that you use is accessible and not full of technical slang - this repository is for beginners and they don't want to be looking up every other word! <br> Try to make things so that there is only a little background knowledge required. <br> Follow the guidelines of layout and directory structure. <br> Remember that your code and content will be curated, which means you might be asked to make changes that you wouldn't necessarily make for your own repositories.

Oh, and if you have a big project on the go it's best to leave yourself notes like I've done below.
