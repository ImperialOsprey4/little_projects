# Contributing to the Little Projects Project

Welcome! Glad you're here and are interested in contributing. Here are the steps:

1. In the top right of your screen you should see a little button that says "fork" - this makes a copy of the repository for you to work on independently.
2. Have a look around, find an issue, and have a go at dealing with it. If you can only get part way, that's ok.
3. Submit your code or documentation by starting a pull request.

[this is to be completed shortly but is a work in progress]
