# little_projects
A group project for Hacktoberfest 2020 - small projects that all use low cost microcontrollers, for beginners to tinker with.


#### What is Hacktoberfest?

Hacktoberfest is a coding initiative that runs once a year throughout the month of October. It encourages participation in the open source community, and is open to everyone of all backgrounds and skill levels. More here: https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/

#### Why have you made this particular repository?

We have other repositories, but they vary in skill level and need for contributions. With this one, we can have multiple little stand alone projects, all in one handy place! In the future it would be nice to point at it when people go "I've not used an arduino before" and like magic we have some projects right there, that we know we have all the bits for at the Hackspace.

#### How do I join in the little projects, er, project?

First, go and register yourself for Hacktoberfest with the same email you use for Github, because then you'll get a nice little reward at the end of the month if you've made 4 valid commits (more about that later). Then head over to the *contributing* guide to see what needs doing, and the guidelines for doing it.

#### Is it a free for all?

If you're not a member of the hackspace, feel free to join in, it's about community after all. As long as your contribution meets the guidelines of the project then code away, do a pull request, and see where it gets you!
