# This directory is for ARDUINO projects only.

Remember to specify what board you have used, and other boards it will work on.
If there is a wiring diagram for your particular board, remember to note if it is different for other boards.
If you don't have another board to test on, open an issue asking someone to test it on theirs and add the wiring diagram.
